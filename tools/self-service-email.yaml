  overview: >-
    The Self Service Email tool generates a pre-filled email template that users
    can send via their email client. It automatically composes the email with
    specified recipients, subject, and body content. If an email client is not
    set up, the tool provides a fallback by saving the email as a plain text
    file for manual use.

    - Define all fields in the email
    - Pull variables directly from Jamf Pro
